Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does
In this project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

We compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

We computed a variety of descriptive statistics, to help us understand the following:
* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trips
* Trip duration
* User information

### Files used
File data for three cities:
* chicago.csv
* new_york.csv
* washington.csv
